// LEETCODE 3147. Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon

// In a mystic dungeon, n magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.

// You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician i, you will be instantly transported to magician (i + k). This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where (i + k) does not exist.

// In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with k jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, absorbing all the energy during the journey.

// You are given an array energy and an integer k. Return the maximum possible energy you can gain.

// Note that when you are reach a magician, you must take energy from them, whether it is negative or positive energy.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: energy = [5,2,-10,-5,1], k = 3

// Output: 3

// Explanation: We can gain a total energy of 3 by starting from magician 1 absorbing 2 + 1 = 3.

// Example 2:

// Input: energy = [-2,-3,-1], k = 2

// Output: -1

// Explanation: We can gain a total energy of -1 by starting from magician 2.

 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= energy.length <= 105
// -1000 <= energy[i] <= 1000
// 1 <= k <= energy.length - 1



// ðŸš€ Approach
// Reverse Accumulation:
// Traverse the array from the end to the beginning. For each index i, if i + k is within bounds, add energy[i + k] to energy[i]. This accumulates the total energy obtainable from index i by jumping every k steps.

// Find Maximum:
// After updating the array, iterate through it to find the maximum energy value.






class Solution {
public:
    int maximumEnergy(vector<int>& energy, int k) {
        int n = energy.size();
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i + k < n) {
                energy[i] += energy[i + k];
            }
        }

        int maxEnergy = energy[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (energy[i] > maxEnergy) maxEnergy = energy[i];
        }
        return maxEnergy;
    }
