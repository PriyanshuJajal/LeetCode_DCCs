// LEETCODE 2327. Number of People Aware of a Secret


// On day 1, one person discovers a secret.

// You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

// Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 6, delay = 2, forget = 4
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// Day 1: Suppose the first person is named A. (1 person)
// Day 2: A is the only person who knows the secret. (1 person)
// Day 3: A shares the secret with a new person, B. (2 people)
// Day 4: A shares the secret with a new person, C. (3 people)
// Day 5: A forgets the secret, and B shares the secret with a new person, D. (3 people)
// Day 6: B shares the secret with E, and C shares the secret with F. (5 people)
// Example 2:

// Input: n = 4, delay = 1, forget = 3
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
// Day 1: The first person is named A. (1 person)
// Day 2: A shares the secret with B. (2 people)
// Day 3: A and B share the secret with 2 new people, C and D. (4 people)
// Day 4: A forgets the secret. B, C, and D share the secret with 3 new people. (6 people)
 

// Constraints:

// 2 <= n <= 1000
// 1 <= delay < forget <= n
 

// ðŸš€ Approach
// Use a dp[] array where dp[i] represents the number of people who start sharing the secret on day i.
// Initialize dp[0] = 1 since one person knows the secret on day 0.
// Maintain a running sum secretAware of people who are currently eligible to share the secret.
// For each day:
//     Add people who become eligible to share (day - delay)
//     Subtract people who forget the secret (day - forget)
//     Store the result in dp[day]
// Finally, sum up the people who still remember the secret on the last forget days.
